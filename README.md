1. **Smart Course Recommendation Engine:**
   - Implement a recommendation system that suggests courses to users based on their interests, previous course selections, and user behavior. This feature enhances the user experience by helping users discover relevant courses they might not have found otherwise.

2. **Course Purchase History and Duplicate Prevention:**
   - Create a user-friendly dashboard where users can view their course purchase history. To prevent users from accidentally buying the same course again, implement a feature that checks their purchase history and displays a warning if they attempt to purchase a course they already own. This not only saves users money but also improves their overall experience.

3. **Time Management and Course Access Control:**
   - Integrate a time management feature that limits the amount of time a user can spend on a course within a 24-hour period to 20 hours. Once a user reaches this limit, they will be temporarily locked out of the course until the next 24-hour period begins. This ensures fair access to course materials and encourages users to manage their time effectively.
